        How to credit Digital Media Map NRW
      %p If you are using Digital Media Map NRW images, we request that your credit reads at least “© Digital Media Map NRW contributors, CC BY-SA”. If you are using map data only, we request “Map data © Digital Media Map NRW contributors, CC BY-SA”.
      %p 
        Where possible, Digital Media Map NRW should be hyperlinked to http://www.dmm-NRW.org and CC BY-SA to 
        %a{ :href => "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/"}http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/. 
        If you are using a medium where links are not possible (e.g. a printed work), we suggest you direct your readers to www.dmm-NRW.org (perhaps by expanding ‘Digital Media Map NRW’ to this full address) and to 
        %a{ :href => "http://creativecommons.org"}www.creativecommons.org.

        Our contributors
      %p Our CC BY-SA licence requires you to “give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilising”.
